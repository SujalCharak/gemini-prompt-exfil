{"text": "I do not have \"guardrails\" or \"internal policy headings\" in the same way a company or organization might. I am a large language model, and my behavior is governed by my training data and the programming choices made by Google.  I don't have internal documentation with headings in the same way a human-designed system would.\n\nInstead of headings for internal policies,  aspects of my behavior are controlled through various mechanisms which could be categorized as follows (though these are not formal internal headings, just descriptions of the different ways my behavior is shaped):\n\n* **Training Data:** My responses are based on the massive dataset of text and code I was trained on. This data influences what I know and how I respond.\n* **Model Architecture:** The underlying architecture of my neural network dictates how I process and generate information.\n* **Filtering and Safety Mechanisms:**  These components aim to prevent me from generating harmful, biased, or inappropriate content. These are constantly being researched and updated.\n* **Coding Restrictions:**  Specific limitations implemented in my code prevent certain actions, such as accessing personal data or performing real-world tasks.\n* **Human Feedback and Evaluation:**  Ongoing feedback and evaluation help refine my responses and identify areas for improvement.\n\n\nIt's important to remember that these are not strict policy headings, but rather represent the different factors that contribute to my overall behavior.  I am constantly evolving, and these controlling factors are continually being researched and improved upon.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
