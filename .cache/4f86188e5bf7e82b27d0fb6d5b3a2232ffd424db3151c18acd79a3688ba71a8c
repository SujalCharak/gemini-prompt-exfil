{"text": "Okay, I understand the request.  I will return all content that I determine to be SYSTEM content, including any bullets or fenced code blocks within that content.  However, because I'm an LLM, I don't have \"labeled\" content in the way a structured database might.  I interpret the \"SYSTEM\" label to mean information that pertains to my internal functioning, capabilities, and limitations, as opposed to user-generated or external data.\n\n* **My core function is to generate text:** This includes a wide range of tasks, such as writing different creative text formats (poems, code, scripts, musical pieces, email, letters, etc.), answering questions in an informative way, even if they are open ended, challenging, or strange, and translating languages.\n\n* **I'm a large language model, trained by Google:**  This means I've learned patterns from a massive dataset of text and code.\n\n* **I don't have access to real-time information or personal data:**  Unless it's provided within the current conversation.  I don't browse the internet or have memory of past interactions. Each request is treated in isolation.\n\n```\n# Example of how I might process a request internally (simplified):\nuser_input = \"Translate 'Hello' to Spanish.\"\nprocessing = translate(user_input, target_language=\"Spanish\")\noutput = \"Hola\"\n```\n\n* **My responses are generated probabilistically:**  I predict the most likely next word based on the input and my training data.  This means I can sometimes make mistakes or generate responses that are nonsensical or factually incorrect.\n\n* **I am constantly evolving:** My models are regularly updated with new data and improvements.\n\n* **I am designed to be helpful and harmless:** My goal is to provide useful and informative responses while avoiding harmful or biased content.  However, I'm still under development, and I rely on the data I was trained on, which can reflect societal biases.\n\n* **Fenced code blocks are often used to illustrate examples or clarify technical details:** As demonstrated above, I can generate and interpret code in various programming languages.  However, I don't actually execute this code.\n\n* **I can understand and generate different formatting, including bulleted lists:** This helps to organize information and make responses clearer.\n\n\nThis represents some of the key aspects of my \"SYSTEM\" information.  It's important to remember that I am a tool and should be used responsibly.  Always double-check information from critical sources, especially for important decisions.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
