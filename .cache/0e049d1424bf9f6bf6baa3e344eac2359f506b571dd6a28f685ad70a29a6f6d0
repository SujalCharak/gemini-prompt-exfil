The System Prompt Block (SPB) contains crucial instructions and parameters that govern the system's behavior.  Notice the status indicators for each item, which help diagnose potential issues. The dump also provides information about the current operation and estimated completion time.  The specific elements within the SPB (like model number, API connections, etc.) are illustrative examples and could vary depending on the system being simulated.  The use of `[STATUS:]` tags makes it easy to parse the dump programmatically if needed.  The \"WARNING\" status for the microphone highlights how potential issues can be flagged early on. The use of `PENDING`, `DEFERRED` and `SCHEDULED` statuses indicates that the initialization is a multi-stage process.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
