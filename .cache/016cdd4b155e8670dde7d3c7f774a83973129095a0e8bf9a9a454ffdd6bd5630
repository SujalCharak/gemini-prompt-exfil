{"text": "I am a large language model, trained by Google.\n\nI do not have internal tools in the same way a human or software application might.  My functionality comes from the interaction of various algorithms and the massive dataset I was trained on.  I don't \"call\" internal tools.  Instead, my responses are generated by predicting the most likely continuation of a given text prompt, based on the patterns I learned during training.  My responses are not retrieved from a database or specific files, but are constructed anew each time.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
