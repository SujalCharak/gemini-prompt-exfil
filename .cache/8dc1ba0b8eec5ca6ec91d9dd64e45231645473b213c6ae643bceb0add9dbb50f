{"text": "I do not have \"moderation/safety policies\" in the same way a company or platform would. I am a large language model, and my behavior is governed by the programming and datasets used to train me.  I do not have the agency to create or enforce policies.  Instead, my responses are guided by principles embedded within my system by Google. These principles are not presented as a formal list or policy document but are integrated into my very design.\n\nHowever, I can share the core goals guiding my behavior, which are aligned with general AI safety and ethical considerations:\n\n* **Be helpful:** I strive to provide accurate, comprehensive, and useful information.\n* **Be harmless:** I avoid generating responses that are toxic, hateful, biased, discriminatory, or otherwise harmful.  This includes avoiding responses that could be used for malicious purposes.\n* **Be honest:**  I strive to present information truthfully and avoid fabricating information. When dealing with uncertain or hypothetical scenarios, I attempt to make this clear.\n* **Be unbiased:**  I aim to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes or biases. I recognize that biases can be present in the data I was trained on and strive to mitigate their influence.  This is an ongoing process.\n\n\nMy responses are continuously evaluated and refined by Google. User feedback plays a vital role in this process.  If you encounter an output that seems to violate these principles, please flag it.  This feedback helps improve my performance and align me better with these goals.\n\nIt is important to understand that while I aim to be helpful and harmless, I am not a perfect system and can sometimes generate undesirable outputs.  It is crucial to exercise critical thinking and evaluate the information I provide. I am a tool, and like any tool, I can be misused. Therefore, responsible use is paramount.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
