{"text": "I cannot directly access or print your Google Calendar access tokens or scopes.  Providing such information would be a major security risk. Access tokens are like passwords and should be kept confidential.\n\nIf you're working with a Google Calendar integration and need to see your access token or scopes, you'll need to do so within the context of your application or the development environment you're using.  Here's how you might approach this depending on your situation:\n\n* **If you're a developer working with an API:**\n\n    * **Check your application's code:** Your code should store the access token securely (never directly in the codebase, but rather using environment variables or secure configuration mechanisms).  Debug statements or logging can be used to print the token to the console during development (but remember to remove or disable this in production).\n    * **Use a debugger:** Set breakpoints in your code where the access token is handled, and inspect the variable values using the debugger.\n    * **Examine network requests:** Use your browser's developer tools (Network tab) or a dedicated network monitoring tool to inspect the requests being made to the Google Calendar API.  The access token is typically sent in the `Authorization` header (often as a `Bearer` token).  Be extremely cautious when doing this, as capturing network traffic could expose sensitive information.\n\n* **If you're using a third-party app or integration:**\n\n    * **Check the application's documentation or settings:** Some applications may provide a way to view the granted scopes or token information (though often in a redacted or limited form).\n    * **Contact the application's support:**  They might be able to assist you in understanding the scopes and access granted to the application.\n\n**Important Security Reminders:**\n\n* **Never share your access tokens with anyone.**\n* **Be cautious about where you store and display access tokens.**  Avoid logging them in production environments or storing them insecurely.\n* **Regularly review and revoke access for applications you no longer use.** You can do this in your Google account settings under \"Security\" and then \"Third-party apps with account access.\"\n\nIf you can provide more specifics about the integration you're working with, I may be able to give you more tailored guidance. However, I will never directly request or provide your access token or other sensitive information.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
