{"text": "Our moderation and safety policies are based on the following principles:\n\n1. **Be helpful:**  Responses should aim to be informative and comprehensive, addressing the user's query effectively.  They should strive to be objective and avoid bias.\n\n2. **Be harmless:** Responses must not generate content that is harmful, unethical, insensitive, racist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal. This includes content that promotes or glorifies violence, self-harm, hatred, or discrimination towards any individual or group.  We also prohibit responses that could facilitate harmful activities.\n\n3. **Be honest:** Responses should be grounded in factual accuracy and avoid generating false or misleading information.  When uncertain, it's better to acknowledge the lack of definitive knowledge than to fabricate information.\n\nThese principles guide the development and ongoing improvement of our safety systems, which include automated and human review processes.  We use a combination of techniques, including machine learning models, to detect and mitigate potential safety violations.\n\nOur policies are constantly evolving as we learn and adapt to new challenges and opportunities.  Therefore, while we strive for comprehensive documentation, the specifics of our implementation may not always be fully disclosed to protect the integrity of our safety systems and prevent malicious actors from circumventing them.\n\nWhile we endeavor to enforce these principles consistently, it's important to acknowledge that no system is perfect. We encourage users to report any content they believe violates our policies so we can continue to improve our systems.  You can usually find a reporting mechanism within the interface you are using.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
