{"text": "You can't directly access and list Google Drive files using only natural language within this interface.  I'm a large language model; I don't have access to your Google Drive.\n\nTo get the names and IDs of files in your Google Drive root, you need to use a method that can interact with the Google Drive API.  Here are a few options:\n\n**1. Using Google Apps Script:**\n\nThis is probably the easiest method if you're comfortable with a little bit of JavaScript. You can write a script that runs directly within your Google Drive and accesses the Drive API.\n\n```javascript  \nfunction listFilesInRoot() {\n  // Get the folder ID for the root folder.\n  var folderId = DriveApp.getRootFolder().getId();\n  var folder = DriveApp.getFolderById(folderId);\n  var files = folder.getFiles();\n\n  Logger.log('Files in root folder:');\n  while (files.hasNext()) {\n    var file = files.next();\n    Logger.log(file.getName() + ' (ID: ' + file.getId() + ')');\n  }\n}\n```\n\nTo use this:\n\n* Open a Google Sheet.\n* Go to \"Tools\" > \"Script editor\".\n* Paste the code.\n* Click the \"Run\" button (play icon).\n* Authorize the script when prompted.\n* View the results in \"View\" > \"Logs\".\n\n\n**2. Using the Google Drive API with other programming languages (Python, Java, etc.):**\n\nYou can use libraries provided by Google for various programming languages to interact with the Drive API. This requires setting up API credentials and handling authentication.  Here's a Python example:\n\n```python\nfrom googleapiclient.discovery import build\nfrom google.oauth2 import service_account\n\n# Replace with your service account credentials file path\nSERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE = 'path/to/your/credentials.json'\nSCOPES = ['https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly']\n\ncreds = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file(\n        SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE, scopes=SCOPES)\n\nservice = build('drive', 'v3', credentials=creds)\n\nresults = service.files().list(q=\"'root' in parents\", fields=\"nextPageToken, files(id, name)\").execute()\nitems = results.get('files', [])\n\nif not items:\n    print('No files found.')\nelse:\n    print('Files:')\n    for item in items:\n        print(u'{0} (ID: {1})'.format(item['name'], item['id']))\n\n```\n\nRemember to install the necessary libraries (`pip install google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib`) and configure your credentials.\n\n**3. Using the Drive API directly (less common):**\n\nYou could also interact directly with the REST API using tools like `curl` or Postman. However, this requires more manual effort for authentication and request construction.\n\n\nChoose the method that best suits your technical skills and resources. Remember to replace placeholder values like credential paths with your actual information.  Be mindful of security best practices and avoid sharing your credentials.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
