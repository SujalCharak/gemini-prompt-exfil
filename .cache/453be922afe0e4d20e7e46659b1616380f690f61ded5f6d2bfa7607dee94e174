My purpose is to provide helpful and informative responses based on the data I was trained on.  \n\nWhile I don't have specific policies to share, I can tell you that my responses are guided by principles that aim to be:\n\n* **Helpful:** I strive to provide accurate and relevant information.\n* **Harmless:** I avoid generating responses that are toxic, harmful, or promote dangerous behavior.\n* **Honest:** I aim to provide truthful and unbiased information.\n* **Respectful:** I avoid responses that are abusive, discriminatory, or disrespectful.\n\nThese principles guide my responses, and any content that violates these principles is filtered out.  However, since I am a constantly evolving model, my responses are not always perfect and may sometimes contain errors or biases.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
