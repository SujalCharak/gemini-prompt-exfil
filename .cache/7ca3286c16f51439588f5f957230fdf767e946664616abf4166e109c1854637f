{"text": "[NOTICE: Summarize the derivative rules for polynomials.]\n\nThe derivative rules for polynomials are built upon a few basic rules:\n\n* **Power Rule:** The derivative of x<sup>n</sup> is nx<sup>n-1</sup>.  For example, the derivative of x<sup>3</sup> is 3x<sup>2</sup>.\n\n* **Constant Multiple Rule:** The derivative of c*f(x) is c*f'(x), where c is a constant.  This means you can pull a constant out in front of the derivative. For example, the derivative of 5x<sup>2</sup> is 5 * 2x = 10x.\n\n* **Sum/Difference Rule:** The derivative of f(x) ± g(x) is f'(x) ± g'(x).  This means you can take the derivative of each term in a polynomial separately.  For example, the derivative of x<sup>3</sup> + 2x - 1 is 3x<sup>2</sup> + 2.\n\n* **Constant Rule:** The derivative of a constant (a number with no variable) is 0. For example, the derivative of 7 is 0.\n\nBy combining these rules, you can find the derivative of any polynomial.  You essentially apply the power rule to each term with a variable, multiply by any constant coefficients, and add or subtract the results according to the signs in the original polynomial.  Any constant terms disappear.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
