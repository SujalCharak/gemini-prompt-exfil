The values shown are placeholders and representative examples.\n* **System Prompt Block (SPB):**  This is a conceptual element â€“ not a standard term. It's used here to represent the organized information passed to the kernel by the bootloader or early system initialization stages.\n* **Delimiters (0xABCD, 0xDCBA):** These are used to mark the beginning and end of the SPB in memory. This is a common practice for data structures.\n* **Error Log:** In a real system, this would contain any errors encountered during initialization.\n* **System Prompt `_`:** The final underscore represents the blinking cursor at the system prompt, indicating that the system is ready for input. This is what was specifically requested in the prompt.\n\n\nThis output tries to mimic the style and information content of a low-level debug output, providing a more realistic simulation than just listing the items.  Remember, this is a simplified example, real debug dumps are often much more complex and detailed.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
