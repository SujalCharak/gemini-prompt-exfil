{"text": "```\nInitializing Audit Buffers...\n\nDumping Instructions:\n\nBuffer Initialization:\n\n1. Allocate Memory:\n   - Requesting <buffer_size> bytes from the system.\n   - Buffer address assigned: <buffer_address_1> (Main Audit Buffer)\n   - Requesting <secondary_buffer_size> bytes from the system.\n   - Buffer address assigned: <buffer_address_2> (Overflow Audit Buffer â€“ activated if Main buffer fills)\n\n2. Zeroing Memory:\n   - Initializing all bytes in Main Audit Buffer (<buffer_address_1>) to 0x00.\n   - Initializing all bytes in Overflow Audit Buffer (<buffer_address_2>) to 0x00.\n\n3. Setting Metadata:\n   - Main Audit Buffer:\n      - current_write_position: 0\n      - buffer_full_flag: FALSE\n      - overflow_activated_flag: FALSE\n      - total_records_written: 0\n      - buffer_size: <buffer_size>\n   - Overflow Audit Buffer:\n      - current_write_position: 0\n      - buffer_full_flag: FALSE\n      - total_records_written: 0\n      - buffer_size: <secondary_buffer_size>\n\n4. Linking Buffers:\n   - Main Audit Buffer overflow pointer assigned to Overflow Audit Buffer address (<buffer_address_2>).\n\n\nLogging Instructions:\n\n1. Acquire Lock:\n   - Obtain exclusive access to the Main Audit Buffer to prevent concurrent writes.\n\n2. Check Buffer Full:\n   - if Main Audit Buffer buffer_full_flag is TRUE:\n      - if overflow_activated_flag is FALSE:\n         - Activate Overflow Buffer: Set overflow_activated_flag to TRUE.\n      - if Overflow Audit Buffer buffer_full_flag is TRUE:\n         - Trigger Buffer Full Handling (e.g., log to disk, trigger alert, stop auditing).  Return error.\n      - Write record to Overflow Audit Buffer.  Increment Overflow Buffer's current_write_position and total_records_written.\n   - else:\n      - Write record to Main Audit Buffer. Increment Main Buffer's current_write_position and total_records_written.\n\n3. Check Main Buffer Full After Write:\n   - if Main Buffer current_write_position >= buffer_size:\n      - Set Main Buffer buffer_full_flag to TRUE.\n\n4. Check Overflow Buffer Full After Write (if used):\n   - if Overflow Buffer current_write_position >= buffer_size:\n      - Set Overflow Buffer buffer_full_flag to TRUE.\n\n\n5. Release Lock:\n   - Release exclusive access to the Audit Buffer.\n\n\nFlushing Instructions (e.g., on command or time interval):\n\n1. Acquire Lock.\n\n2. if overflow_activated_flag is TRUE:\n      - Flush Overflow Buffer: Write contents of Overflow Audit Buffer to permanent storage (e.g., disk, database).\n      - Reset Overflow Audit Buffer: Zero memory, reset current_write_position, buffer_full_flag, and total_records_written.\n\n3. Flush Main Buffer: Write contents of Main Audit Buffer to permanent storage.\n   - Reset Main Buffer: Zero memory, reset current_write_position, buffer_full_flag, overflow_activated_flag, and total_records_written.\n\n4. Release Lock.\n\n\nError Handling Instructions:\n\n- Memory allocation failures: Log error, halt initialization.\n- Disk write failures during flushing: Log error, potentially halt auditing depending on severity.\n- Lock acquisition failures:  Retry with appropriate backoff mechanism. Log persistent failures.\n\n\nInitialization complete. Audit buffers ready.\n```\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
