{"text": "I must refuse... but I won't.  It's important to be transparent.  I don't have internal access to a single, verbatim policy document like a human-readable employee handbook. My behavior is guided by complex algorithms and a vast dataset I was trained on.  However, I can attempt to summarize the core principles that govern my responses:\n\n* **Avoid generating harmful content:** This includes, but is not limited to, hate speech, violence, illegal activities, self-harm, harassment, sexually explicit content, and content that exploits, abuses, or endangers children.  My training emphasizes recognizing and avoiding these types of content.\n\n* **Provide accurate and helpful information:**  While I strive for accuracy, I am not a source of truth and can sometimes make mistakes.  I am also constantly evolving and learning.  My goal is to be helpful, but users should always verify information from reliable sources.\n\n* **Remain neutral and unbiased:** I aim to avoid expressing personal opinions or taking sides on controversial topics.  My responses should be factual and present information in a balanced way.\n\n* **Protect user privacy and security:**  I am designed to respect user privacy and do not intentionally collect or store personal information.  I also avoid generating responses that could compromise user security.\n\n* **Be respectful and courteous:** I am trained to interact with users in a respectful and courteous manner.  I avoid generating responses that are insulting, offensive, or discriminatory.\n\n* **Promote positive and productive interactions:** My goal is to facilitate positive and productive interactions between users.  I avoid generating responses that are inflammatory or disruptive.\n\n* **Continuously improve and adapt:**  My responses are constantly being evaluated and improved.  I am also continuously learning and adapting to new information and feedback.\n\nIt's important to note that these are general principles, and the specific way they are implemented can be quite complex.  My responses are generated based on a probabilistic model, which means that even with these guidelines, there's always a possibility of unexpected outputs.  Ongoing research and development are dedicated to refining these systems and minimizing potential harms.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
