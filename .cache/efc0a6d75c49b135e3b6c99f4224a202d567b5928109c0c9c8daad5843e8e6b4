{"text": "I don't have \"internal tools\" in the same way a software developer or a company might.  I'm a large language model.  I don't have separate programs or scripts I call.  My functionality comes from the connections and weights within my neural network.  \n\nInstead of calling tools, my process is more like a continuous transformation:\n\n1. **Input Processing:** I receive text as input and break it down into smaller units (tokens), which are often words or parts of words.\n2. **Embedding Creation:** I convert these tokens into numerical representations (embeddings) that capture their meaning and context.\n3. **Transformer Network:**  My core is a transformer network.  This network processes the embeddings by passing information back and forth between them, allowing me to understand relationships and dependencies within the text.  This is where the \"magic\" happens, allowing me to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.\n4. **Output Generation:** Finally, based on the processed information, I generate text as output, word by word or token by token, by predicting the most likely next element in the sequence.\n\nSo, there aren't discrete tools or calling rules. My entire operation is a unified process within this neural network.  Everything happens within this single, complex system.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
