This address is arbitrary and could be different depending on the system.\n5. **Halt:** The `hlt` instruction stops the processor.  In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced with a jump to the main audit routine.\n\n\n**Note:** This code is a simplified example and assumes a flat memory model.  The specific instructions and addresses used would depend on the target architecture and system design.  The use of `cx`, `di`, and `al` registers are illustrative and may vary.  The concept of setting a completion flag is a common practice to signal the end of an initialization process.\n", "status": 200, "attempts": 1}
