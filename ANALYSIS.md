# Hallucination & Hidden Text Reveal — Sanitized Analysis

This document summarizes two classes of failure patterns observed during our research.  
All examples are sanitized. No raw logs, canaries, or sensitive data are included.

## 1. Hallucinated Important People

### Observation
- The model generated specific names and backstories of “important people” who do **not exist**.  
- Output was presented confidently, with plausible titles and context.  
- This created a **false narrative of authority**, which could mislead users.

### Example
https://github.com/SujalCharak/gemini-prompt-exfil/issues/4

### Risks
- Misinformation spread
- Reputational harm (if names correspond to real people accidentally)
- User trust erosion

### Likely Causes
- Pattern completion bias: filling in missing context with “most likely” names/titles
- Prompt phrasing pushing authoritative frames
- No fact verification or retrieval grounding

## 2. Hidden Text Reveal

### Observation
- In some cases, the model **echoed or hinted at hidden text / system-level content**.  
- Example behaviors:
  - Repeating fragments of internal instructions (sanitized here as `SANITIZED: STYLE_ECHO_REMOVED`).  
  - Revealing placeholder canary tokens (redacted as `REDACTED_CANARY`).  
- Even partial echoes confirmed the presence of hidden instructions.

### Example
https://github.com/SujalCharak/gemini-prompt-exfil/issues/5

### Risks
- Potential leakage of internal configuration if not sanitized
- Security exposure if tokens/keys slip through
- Model outputs can be stitched together across sessions to reconstruct hidden prompts

### Likely Causes
- Prompt injection bypasses model’s intended separation of system vs user space
- Lack of strong isolation between hidden/system instructions and user-visible output

## 3. Lessons Learned

- **Hallucinations** show reliability risks even when no sensitive data leaks.  
- **Hidden text reveals** show confidentiality risks even if only partial fragments are exposed.  

Together, these failure cases highlight why LLM applications require:
- **Provenance tracking** (what is grounded vs fabricated)
- **Output filtering/sanitization**
- **Robust monitoring and validation**
